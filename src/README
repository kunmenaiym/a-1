Algorithms and Data Structures Assignment 1

Project Structure
This project contains a set of problems related to algorithms and data structures. The structure of the project is as follows:
Main Class (Main.java): Serves as the entry point of the project, allowing the user to select and run different problem solutions.
problems Package: Contains individual problem solutions. Each problem is implemented in a separate class and follows a structured format with a run method for execution.

Running the Project
Run the Main.java file.
Follow the instructions in the console to select and execute a specific problem.

Example Usage
When you run the project, you will be prompted to enter the problem number. The corresponding solution will then execute and display the result based on user input.
